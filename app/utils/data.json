      "body": "I have been going to Billy since last year to work on anxiety and nervous system regulation, and he is brilliant. He is the first acupuncturist I've tried where I actually feel a full body release and parasympathetic downshifts each session. It helps too that he is so thorough, gives you 90 min of care and attention, and follows needling with manual therapy. I highly highly recommend him.",
